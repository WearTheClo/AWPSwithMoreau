The evaluation file stores the performances of SGP [1], SGAP, MSGAP, and S-ADDOPT [2] under a fully connected network graph with scale 6. This result is independent of the paper to show the repeatability of our experimental results.

Our paper "Adaptive Weighting Push-SUM for Decentralized Optimization with Statistical Diversity" is under review and waiting for release.
